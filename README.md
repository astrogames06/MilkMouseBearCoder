- 👋 Hi, I’m @MilkMouseBearCoder
- 👀 I’m interested in programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on raylib_zero

``` c++
class Marshroom
{
public:
    std::vector<std::string> langs = {
        "C#",
        "Python",
        "Lua",
        "C++"
    };

    std::string FavLang = "C++";

    int YearsProgramming = 3;
};
```
